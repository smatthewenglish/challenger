# Challenger (Basic)

Timely implementation of the Rust Coding Test. 

## Overview

As I was saying to Leon, my Rust skills are a bit rusty (*no pun intended*). 

Certainly I'm aware that this is far from the complete solution described by the specification. 

Nevertheless I'd say it reflects my coding style, insofar as these steps I've taken here are more or less similar to the initial steps I'd take toward creation of any more robust program. 

If you want a better indication of my work I'd encourage you to check out `https://github.com/tschess`.

## Instructions

Run like so: 

```
cargo run -- transactions.csv > accounts.csv
```
